I am a Chief Scientist and Executive Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Director of the CRI Center for Computational Systems Biology at **Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU)**. 

Prior to this appointment, I led the Biocomputing Unit and served as an Associate Professor at the Integrated Cancer Genomics Division of the **Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen)** from its inception in 2003 until 2016. I also served as an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing, Informatics, Decision Systems Engineering (CIDSE) at **Arizona State University** from 2004 to 2011.

My research interests focus on:
1.  **Mathematical modeling** of molecular networks.
2.  **Computational methods** to analyze high-throughput multi-omics data to identify disease biomarkers.
3.  **Computational models** to diagnose patients or predict patient outcomes (e.g., disease subtypes or drug response).

My objective is to understand the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders. Since joining PVAMU in 2017, I have secured approximately $10M in research and training funding.

**Current Research Projects:**
* Pulmonary hypertension and cardio-pulmonary vascular-brain research (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine)
* Engineering methanogenesis (Sandia National Lab)
* Diabetes (Texas A&M University)
* Sorghum/wheat shoot-branching (USDA/NIFA)
